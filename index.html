    <ul>
      <li>Difference between 'switch' and 'if/else'?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>'Switch' - has a set of cases available and will select one of those cases
            based on what has been inputed.</li>
          <li>'If/else' - has a set of possible scenarios and each scenario will be checked
            until one matches the criteria of one of the if statements and then it will run
            the code of that statement.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>When to us '=' vs '==' vs '.equals'?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>'=' is declarative. It is used to set a variable equal to something else.</li>
            <li>'==' is a comparison.  You can use this to check if something equals something else.</li>
            <li>'.equals' is used to compare things inside String variables.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What is 'Math' in 'Math.random()'?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>'Math' is a built in java function.</li>
          <li>'.random()' returns a Double.</li>
          <li>The 'M' in 'Math' is capitalized to show that it is a built in class.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What does it mean to 'cast a double to an int'?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You remove everything to the right of the decimal.  9.99 -> 9.</li>
          <li>You do this in various 'Math.random()' scenarios where you want
            to find a random number between ## and ##.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between 'while' and 'do while' loops?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>'while' sets the contingency for statement first and only runs the code
              after if that contingency is met.</li>
            <li>'do while' sets the contingency last so the code after 'do' will always
              be run at least one time.</li>
            <li>'do while' has the benefit of running the code inside at least once before
              leaving that part of the code, or continuing based on if the 'while' part
              is met or not.  Sometimes what you're checking in the condition is something
              you won't know until after you've run the code once.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What happens when you include 'import java.util.Scanner;' in your code?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It imports a scanner into your code so you can take inputs from a user.</li>
            <li>The functionality comes from a java utility database.</li>
            <li>'java' in 'java.util.Scanner;' is the head directory where we can locate
              the util directory and then actually import 'Scanner.'
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What is 'void' in a method declaration?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>'void' means that the code will not return any information once it is finished.</li>
            <li>This differs from a return type because a return type would return information once
            it is finished</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between a 'parameter' and an 'argument?'</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A 'parameter' is a variable in a method definition.</li>
            <li>When that method is called, the 'arguement' is the data that moves into the
              'parameter.'</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What experience do you have coding?  What have you created already?
          What do you want to create during/after the program?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I have little experience with coding, but I have written some very basic scripts in the past
              that would auto shut down a computer, etc.</li>
            <li>I have created code for most of the examples in the "Java the Hard Way" book.</li>
            <li>After/during the program I'd like to create and work on code for apps.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>My main goal is to learn the skills it takes to be a sought after developer.</li>
            <li>I will achieve this by studying hard and asking questions and investing time outside
              of class to learn things that I am struggling with.</li>
            <li>My big "why," is, Why are there so many different coding languages?  Why did they origionate?</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What sill learning pitfalls have you encountered?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I have become arrogant when things are easy for me, and start to slack.</li>
            <li>I am going to do things differently by investing all of my time into this program
              and coding to take things seriously and hold myself accountable to putting this
              education as a top priority in my life.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>When you get frustrated and discouraged, what do you do?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When I get frustrated and discouraged, I take a break/breather.  I move on to
              other things and when I come back to the thing that frustrated/discouraged me,
              I can see it through a new light and properly address it then.</li>
            <li>I will keep encouraging myself through remembering why I am doing this.  I am working
              on this to move my life forward and I will continue to put everything towards that this
              next 4 months, and beyond that.</li>
